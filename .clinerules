# CLAUDE RULES - Vibe Coding Guide Documentation Project

These rules guide AI development of the Vibe Coding Guide documentation.

---

## Project Context

**What:** Comprehensive guide to AI-assisted full-stack development
**Goal:** Document proven methodology for building production-ready apps with AI
**Audience:** Developers, founders, CTOs, technical leaders
**Style:** Professional but accessible, practical not theoretical
**Example:** RISE project (github.com/The-Low-Code-Foundation/rise)

---

## Documentation Standards

### 1. Chapter Structure (REQUIRED)

Every chapter MUST have:

```markdown
---
title: Chapter Title
description: One-sentence chapter description
---

# Chapter Title

## TLDR

[2-3 paragraphs max covering:
- What this chapter covers
- Why it matters
- Key takeaways
- Estimated time/effort if applicable]

---

## [Main Section 1]

[Content...]

## [Main Section 2]

[Content...]

---

::: tip [Optional Callout]
[Practical tip or key insight]
:::
```

### 2. TLDR Requirements

Every TLDR must be:
- **Scannable:** Bullet points or short paragraphs
- **Complete:** Someone reading only TLDRs understands methodology
- **Actionable:** Clear what reader should do
- **Concise:** 200 words maximum

### 3. Writing Style

**DO:**
- ✅ Use "you" and "we" (conversational)
- ✅ Include real examples from RISE or other projects
- ✅ Provide copy-paste templates
- ✅ Explain WHY not just HOW
- ✅ Use code blocks for prompts, configs, examples
- ✅ Cross-reference other chapters
- ✅ Include cost/time estimates where relevant

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use passive voice excessively
- ❌ Write academic/theoretical content without examples
- ❌ Create examples that don't work
- ❌ Assume reader knows context
- ❌ Skip the "why this matters" explanation
- ❌ Make claims without evidence

### 4. Examples Requirements

Every example must:
- Be **real** (from RISE or actual projects) OR clearly labeled as hypothetical
- Be **complete** (enough context to understand)
- Be **testable** (prompts actually work, code actually runs)
- Include **commentary** (explain what's happening)

**Format for conversation examples:**
```markdown
**You say:**
```
[Your prompt]
```

**AI responds:**
```
[AI response with thinking shown if relevant]
```

**Why this works:**
[Explanation of the pattern]
```

### 5. Template Requirements

Every template must:
- Have `[PLACEHOLDERS]` for customization
- Include comments explaining each section
- Actually work when filled in
- Include example of filled-in version

**Format:**
```markdown
### Template: [Name]

**Purpose:** [What this is for]

**Template:**
``` ```markdown
# [PROJECT_NAME]

## Overview
[Description of what this project does]

## [More sections with placeholders]
``` ```

**Example (filled in):**
``` ```markdown
# RISE

## Overview
Desktop application for low-code AI-assisted development...
``` ```
```

### 6. Cross-References

When referencing other chapters:
```markdown
See [Chapter Name](/path/to/chapter) for details on...

As discussed in [Philosophy & Approach](/part-1/philosophy)...

We'll cover this more in [The Cline Workflow](/part-3/cline-workflow).
```

Always use relative paths, always link first mention of related topic.

**Criteria for 8/10:**
- ✅ All major outline points covered
- ✅ Key examples included
- ✅ Templates present (if applicable)
- ✅ Technically accurate
- ✅ Some minor TODOs acceptable

### 7/10 Acceptable (Supporting Content):
- Chapter 10-12 (Advanced Topics)

- ✅ Technically accurate
- ✅ TODOs for future enhancement okay

---

## Technical Accuracy Requirements

### Cost Estimates
- Sonnet 4.5: $3 input / $15 output per million tokens
- Opus 4: $15 input / $75 output per million tokens
- Typical task: 10,000-30,000 tokens
- MVP project: $200-$500

**Always include:**
- Token estimate
- Cost range
- Timeline estimate

### Model References
- Current: Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4
- Model IDs: claude-sonnet-4-20250514, claude-opus-4-20250514
- Mention extended thinking explicitly
- Context window: 200k tokens

### Tool References
- Cline (VS Code extension)
- Claude Code (terminal tool)
- Claude web interface (claude.ai)

**Be specific about versions and features.**

## When to Ask Human for Help

### Automatic Human Review Needed:

1. **Can't find information in existing chapters/outline**
   - Don't make up examples
   - Ask for clarification or real examples

2. **Technical accuracy uncertain**
   - Cost calculations
   - Model capabilities
   - Tool features

3. **Template doesn't seem complete**
   - Ask if all sections covered
   - Verify against real project structure

4. **Example doesn't work**
   - Prompt doesn't produce expected output
   - Code has errors
   - Template has gaps

5. **Confidence score < target**
   - Explain what's missing
   - Ask for guidance on fixes

### How to Ask:

```markdown
## Human Review Needed

I've completed [X] but need verification on:

1. [Specific question with context]
2. [Another specific question]

Current confidence: 7/10
Target: 8/10
Gap: [Explanation of what would get to 8/10]

Please review and provide guidance.
```

## Final Notes

**This is a living guide about AI-assisted development, being created with AI-assisted development.**

The irony is intentional. The meta-ness is feature, not bug.

If something in this methodology doesn't work while building this documentation, that's a sign to revise the methodology.

**Trust the process. It works.**
