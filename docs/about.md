# About the Vibe Coding Guide

## TLDR

The Vibe Coding Guide is a comprehensive resource for AI-assisted software development, created through a collaboration between **The Low Code Foundation** (a French non-profit) and **Visual Hive** (an AI startup based in London). Written by **Richard Osborne**, CTO of Visual Hive, this guide documents proven methodologies for building production-ready applications with AI.

## The Collaboration

### The Low Code Foundation

[The Low Code Foundation](https://thelowcodefoundation.com) is a **French non-profit organisation** dedicated to:

- **Promoting low-code development** — Making software development accessible to more people
- **Training and education** — Providing resources and training for modern development approaches
- **Community building** — Connecting developers, businesses, and educators around efficient development practices

The foundation believes that the future of software development lies in reducing unnecessary complexity while maintaining quality and capability.

### Visual Hive

[Visual Hive](https://visualhive.co) is an **AI startup based in London** focused on:

- **AI-assisted conference tools** — Building software that helps conference organisers increase attendee and exhibitor satisfaction, as well as overall revenue
- **Data analytics** — Using data collected from conference deployments, tools and partners to create critical data insights
- **Managed services** — Creating custom solutions for a wide range of problems in the conference industry and beyond

Visual Hive's mission is to make AI a genuine multiplier for conference organisers, not just a novelty.

## The Author

**Richard Osborne** is the CTO of Visual Hive and the primary author of this guide. 

Drawing from hands-on experience building production applications using AI-assisted development, Richard has documented the patterns, practices, and pitfalls discovered through real projects—including the RISE project that serves as the primary example throughout this guide.

## The Methodology

This guide exists because most approaches to AI-assisted coding fail. People expect to describe an app and have AI build it. The reality is more nuanced.

The methodology documented here was developed through practical experience:

1. **Validate first** — Use AI for exploratory conversations before committing to build
2. **Document systematically** — Create lean documentation that gives AI the context it needs
3. **Work in focused tasks** — New conversation per task, with clear scope
4. **Check quality continuously** — Confidence scoring and phase audits catch problems early
5. **Build incrementally** — Each phase must work before starting the next

This isn't theory. It's what actually works.

## Acknowledgments

This guide was built using the methodology it documents—AI-assisted development with human oversight, quality gates, and iterative refinement. The irony is intentional. The meta-ness is a feature, not a bug.

Special thanks to the developers, founders, and teams who tested these approaches and provided feedback that shaped the methodology.
