## The Problem

Most AI-assisted coding fails because people try to build everything at once. No scoping. No quality gates. No documentation. Result: expensive, broken code.

## The Solution

1. **Brainstorm first** — Let AI help you scope a realistic MVP
2. **Document before coding** — Five lean docs that AI reads every session
3. **Work in tasks** — New chat per task, focused execution
4. **Check quality** — Confidence scoring, phase audits
5. **Build on solid ground** — Each phase works before starting the next

## Who This Is For

- Developers who want AI to accelerate their work without producing garbage
- Founders validating ideas before burning runway
- Team leads establishing standards for AI-assisted development
