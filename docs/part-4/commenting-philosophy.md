# Commenting Philosophy

## TLDR

Aim for 50% comments. Sounds excessive—it's not.

Future you, future developers, and AI in future sessions all need to understand *why* you made decisions, not just *what* the code does.

---

## The Case for Heavy Comments

Traditional wisdom: "Good code is self-documenting. Minimize comments."

That advice assumes:
- The same person maintains the code
- They remember their decisions
- They have full context

AI-assisted development breaks all three:
- AI has no memory between sessions
- You forget decisions after a few weeks
- Context gets lost

Comments are how you preserve context.

## What to Comment

**The "why" behind decisions:**

```python
# Skills weighted 2x because professional connections
# matter more than hobby overlap at business events.
# Revisit weighting after user feedback in v1.0.
score = (skills_overlap * 2) + interests_overlap
```

Without that comment, someone later asks "why multiply by 2?" and nobody knows.

**Non-obvious behavior:**

```javascript
// Intentionally delay 100ms before redirect.
// Immediate redirect causes flash of unstyled content
// on slower connections. See LEARNINGS.md 2024-12-10.
await sleep(100);
window.location.href = '/dashboard';
```

**Trade-offs you considered:**

```python
# Using simple tag matching instead of vector similarity.
# Vectors are more accurate but 10x slower for 1000+ users.
# Good enough for MVP. Upgrade path: switch to Qdrant in v1.0.
def match_users(user1, user2):
    ...
```

**Deferred decisions:**

```javascript
// TODO(v1.0): Add rate limiting here.
// For MVP, we trust our small user base.
// Before public launch, add express-rate-limit.
app.post('/api/login', async (req, res) => {
    ...
});
```

## What NOT to Comment

**The obvious:**

```python
# Bad: explains what, not why
i = i + 1  # increment i

# Also bad
user = get_user(id)  # get the user
```

**Lies:**

```python
# Connects to production database
def connect():
    return connect_to_staging()  # Comment is wrong!
```

Outdated comments are worse than no comments. When you change code, update comments.

## Function Documentation

Every function gets a docstring explaining:
- What it does (one sentence)
- Why it exists (if not obvious)
- Parameters and return value
- Example if helpful

```python
def calculate_match_score(user1, user2):
    """
    Calculate networking match score between two users.
    
    Higher scores = better match for business networking.
    Skills weighted 2x because professional overlap matters more.
    
    Args:
        user1: User dict with 'skills' and 'interests' lists
        user2: User dict with 'skills' and 'interests' lists
    
    Returns:
        int: Score from 0-20 (typical range)
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_match_score(
        ...     {'skills': ['python'], 'interests': ['hiking']},
        ...     {'skills': ['python', 'js'], 'interests': ['hiking']}
        ... )
        3  # (1 skill * 2) + (1 interest * 1)
    """
    skills_overlap = len(set(user1['skills']) & set(user2['skills']))
    interests_overlap = len(set(user1['interests']) & set(user2['interests']))
    return (skills_overlap * 2) + interests_overlap
```

Takes 60 seconds to write. Saves hours of "what does this do?" later.

---

## The AI Memory Problem

When you start a new task session, AI reads your code. 

**Uncommented code:**
```python
def process(data):
    if len(data) > 1000:
        data = data[:1000]
    result = transform(data)
    time.sleep(0.1)
    return result
```

AI thinks: "Why truncate at 1000? Why sleep? What does transform do?" It guesses, often wrong.

**Commented code:**
```python
def process(data):
    # Limit to 1000 items - API rate limit is 1000/minute
    if len(data) > 1000:
        data = data[:1000]
    
    result = transform(data)
    
    # Brief delay prevents hitting rate limit on rapid successive calls
    time.sleep(0.1)
    
    return result
```

AI knows exactly what's happening and why. It makes better decisions.

## The Three-Month Test

When writing comments, ask: "Will I understand this in three months?"

If you're writing something clever or non-obvious, you won't remember why. Comment it now.

```javascript
// This regex looks insane but it handles:
// - International phone formats (+1, +44, etc.)
// - Optional parentheses around area code
// - Spaces, dashes, or dots as separators
// Tested against 500 real phone numbers from user data.
const phoneRegex = /^\+?[\d\s\-().]{10,}$/;
```

Future you will be grateful.

## Quick Checklist

Before finishing a task:

- [ ] Every function has a docstring
- [ ] Non-obvious code has inline comments explaining "why"
- [ ] Trade-offs are documented
- [ ] TODOs reference when they should be done (v1.0, Phase 2, etc.)
- [ ] No commented-out code (delete it, git has history)

---

## The ROI

Heavy commenting adds maybe 20% to writing time. It saves:

- Hours debugging "why does this work this way?"
- Rework from AI misunderstanding your code
- Onboarding time for new developers
- Your own confusion returning after a break

20% more effort for 10x less pain. Good trade.
